# Jarvis-Voice-Assistant-Python-Project
• Built a voice-controlled virtual assistant using Python, integrating speech_recognition and pyttsx3 for speech-to-text and text-to-speech.
• Automated tasks including opening websites, playing music, telling jokes, reporting date/time, and reading live news via NewsAPI.
• Implemented a modular command handler to process multiple voice inputs and execute real-time responses.
• Utilized external libraries (requests, pyjokes, random) and API integration to extend functionality.
